    <p>RetroGems Re-Imagined started with a simple idea which was to give old clothes a new life without hurting the planet. It is an online thrift boutique where vintage wear is given a chance 
        to reign in this modern world. As RetroGems, we handpick unique clothing, from retro gems to forgotten favorites, we offer them a second chance to shine.<i> Everything deserves a second 
        chance, right?</i> We are more than just a store. People can also use our platform to donate or sell clothes they no longer wear, making space in their closets while helping others
     discover something special.</p>

<ol>
        <li><b>Mission Statement</b></li>

        <li><b>Vision Statement</b></li>
        <p>Our vision is to build a community where fashion has meaning, nothing goes to waste, and everyone can express themselves through clothing that has a history and tells a story.</p>
